#### What is it?

The **Avatars** application generates avatars for user records. Say goodbye to boring Initials!<!--endexcerpt-->

> x_snc_avatars.Avatar().get(String sys_id, String sprite_collection);

> x_snc_avatars.Avatar().getRandom(String sys_id);

- sys_id = sys_user.sys_id (Required)
- sprite_collection = force a specific sprite to be returned (Optional)

#### Included in update set

- Script include that allows you generate avatars
- User form UI Action that allows you to generate an avatar for the current user record (Requires the user_admin role). The generated avatar is based on the user's gender and sys_id. Will always produce the same result.
- User form UI Action that allows you to generate a completely random avatar regardless of gender and sys_id. Will always produce a different result.
- Business Rule that will generate an avatar for new user records as they are created.
- Script Executor that can be run which will generate an avatar for every user record that doesn't already have a photo.
- System Properties that allow you further customize how it runs, organized into a system property category that will appear as `Avatar Properties` within the `System UI` Application in the navigation menu.
